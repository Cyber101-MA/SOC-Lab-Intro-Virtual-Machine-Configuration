# Kali Linux – Basic Notes

## Purpose
This Kali Linux VM is used as the **attacker machine** in the home lab.  
Its only purpose in this intro repo is to exist as part of the lab structure.  
All attack simulations, tools, and testing steps will be documented later in the mini‑tasks repo.

## Notes
- This VM will be used to generate security events for the SIEM.
- It will simulate brute-force attempts, scans, and other activity.
